INFO 3300 Status Report 2

So far, each of us has come up with at least 2 ideas for the project that we can create with accessible datasets.

Before the next progress report:

Mark: Manually parse the .pdf dataset into .csv with header: Dept, Number, Size, Median Grade

Richard: Create JS parse file function to turn .csv into usable data

Stephen: Create skeleton graph
